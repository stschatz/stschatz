Let me introduce myself.

My name is Stewart Schatz. I have over 25 years of Professional Information Technology experience in a wide variety of technologies. Much to my surprise, most of my career has been spent learning the inner workings of Oracle JD Edwards EnterpriseOne CNC Administration. Why was it a surprise? Because when I started down this road, I thought that it would be a 3-5 year thing and I'd move on to bigger and better things. However, JDE is not a one-dimensional piece of software that you learn and then do 25% of the time. If you want to do it right, JDE CNC is an all or nothing endeavor. Now, I'm not just an old GREEN-SCREEN JDE CNC or pasty-skinned tech-geek, although I am working on it. I also enjoy many outdoor activities like hunting, hiking, camping and trying to keep up with the rest of my family.

### What I do:

I provide world-class, highly technical solutions and services as an Oracle JD Edwards CNC Administrator specializing in system optimization/automation, system monitoring, troubleshooting, problem solving and upgrades/updates. By utilizing my years of professional IT experience in a wide array of technologies, the solutions that I provide are effective, efficient, and innovative.

### Some of the skills that I've developed:
*   Oracle JD Edwards
*   Oracle Database
*   Microsoft SQL Server
*   IBM iSeries/AS400
*   WebLogic
*   IBM DB2
*   PowerShell
*   JavaScript
*   SQL
*   HTML/XHTML
*   VBScript
*   Java
